# Creating a Professional Chess Game with AWS Q CLI

## 1. Introduction

In this blog post, I'll share my experience creating a professional-looking chess game using Python and PyGame with the assistance of AWS Q CLI. AWS Q is Amazon's AI assistant that can help with coding tasks, and it proved to be an invaluable tool for this project.

The goal was to create a fully functional chess game with a professional UI, complete with all standard chess pieces, legal move validation, and AI opponent functionality. Rather than building everything from scratch, I leveraged AWS Q's code generation capabilities to accelerate the development process.

## 2. Installation and Setup

Before starting the project, I needed to set up my environment with the necessary tools:

1. **Install AWS Q CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install AWS CLI if not already installed
   pip install awscli
   
   # Configure AWS credentials
   aws configure
   
   # Install AWS Q CLI
   pip install aws-q-cli
   ```

2. **Required Python Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame python-chess
   ```

3. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   chess_game/
   ├── chess_gui.py        # Main game file
   ├── generate_pieces.py  # Script to generate chess pieces
   ├── pieces/             # Directory for piece images
   └── README.md           # Documentation
   ```

## 3. Prompt I Used with AWS Q CLI

I started by providing AWS Q with a detailed prompt describing what I wanted to build. Here's the prompt I used:

```
Create a Chess game using Python and PyGame. The board should be 8x8 and styled like a real chessboard with alternating light and dark square colors. Draw or use images for all standard chess pieces and display their names like "Pawn", "Rook", "Knight", "Bishop", "Queen", and "King" either on or just below each piece using readable fonts. The game should be played between a human and a basic AI. Use the `python-chess` library to validate legal moves. Implement piece selection, movement, and capturing logic. Ensure turns alternate properly between the player and the AI. The AI can make random valid moves for simplicity. Add basic UI interactions like selecting a piece and clicking to move it. Avoid implementing check/checkmate logic unless simple. Focus on functionality, clarity, and piece visibility.
```

After receiving the initial implementation, I provided additional feedback:

```
Please can you work on UI of game? Make the chessboard look more like a professional chessboard, if possible. You can do changes as per your convenience, but please take note on better Professional UI.
```

And later, I requested specific improvements:

```
Can you help me to make shape of pawn more proper, it looks unprofessional; also please make size of entire chessboard a little bit small, as it's not properly fitting my screen.
```

## 4. Output (with explanation by AWS Q)

AWS Q generated a complete chess game implementation with the following components:

### Main Game File (chess_gui.py)
The main game file implements:
- A professional 8x8 chessboard with elegant styling
- Chess piece rendering and movement
- Game state tracking and display
- Player and AI turn management
- Legal move validation using python-chess
- Interactive UI elements (highlighting, move indicators)

### Piece Generator (generate_pieces.py)
A utility script that creates custom chess piece images with:
- Distinct designs for each piece type
- Professional styling with proper outlines and highlights
- Color differentiation between white and black pieces

### AWS Q's Explanation:
> "I've created a chess game with PyGame that meets your requirements. The game features a professional-looking chessboard with alternating light and dark squares, custom-designed chess pieces, and a clean UI. The game logic is handled by the python-chess library, which ensures all moves are valid according to standard chess rules.
>
> The UI includes piece selection highlighting, valid move indicators (dots for empty squares, rings for captures), last move highlighting, and a status bar showing the current game state. The player controls the white pieces, and a simple AI makes random valid moves for the black pieces.
>
> I've adjusted the board size to fit better on your screen and improved the pawn design to look more professional. The game now has a more elegant appearance while maintaining all the functionality you requested."

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Professional UI**: Elegant color scheme with cream and forest green squares on a dark background
2. **Custom Chess Pieces**: Visually distinct pieces with professional design
3. **Game Logic**: Complete chess rules enforced by python-chess library
4. **Interactive Elements**: Piece selection, move highlighting, and game state tracking
5. **AI Opponent**: Computer player making random valid moves

## 5. What I Learned

Working on this chess game project with AWS Q taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **AI-Assisted Development**: AWS Q can significantly accelerate development by generating complete, working code based on detailed prompts. This allowed me to focus on refining the game rather than building everything from scratch.

2. **Iterative Improvement**: The ability to provide feedback and request specific changes made the development process more efficient. I could start with a basic implementation and gradually improve it.

3. **Library Integration**: I learned how powerful it is to combine libraries like PyGame (for graphics) and python-chess (for game logic) rather than reinventing the wheel.

4. **UI Design Principles**: Through the process of refining the chess game's appearance, I gained insights into what makes a game interface look professional - things like consistent color schemes, proper spacing, and visual feedback.

5. **Prompt Engineering**: I discovered that providing clear, detailed prompts with specific requirements leads to better results from AI assistants like AWS Q.

6. **Code Organization**: The project demonstrated good practices in organizing code, separating concerns (UI, game logic, asset generation), and creating maintainable software.

7. **Rapid Prototyping**: Using AWS Q allowed me to quickly prototype and test ideas, making it easier to experiment with different approaches to game design.

In conclusion, AWS Q proved to be an excellent tool for creating a professional chess game. The combination of AI assistance and human direction resulted in a polished product that would have taken much longer to develop from scratch. This experience has shown me the potential of AI-assisted development for accelerating software projects while maintaining quality and customization.
