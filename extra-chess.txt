The game appears to be starting up. You should now see the chess game window with the professional UI featuring:

• A chessboard with cream and forest green squares on a dark background
• Custom designed chess pieces
• Board coordinates in standard chess notation (a-h, 1-8)

To play the game:
1. Click on a white piece to select it
2. Valid moves will be highlighted with dots (empty squares) or rings (captures)
3. Click on a destination square to move your piece
4. The AI will automatically respond with a move

You're playing as white, and the AI is playing as black. Standard chess rules apply, including special moves like castling and en 
passant.

To quit the game, simply close the window when you're done playing.
